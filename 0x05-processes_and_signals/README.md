Project: 0x05. Processes and signals


0. Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.

2. Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.

3. Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.

4. Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely. 

5. We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.

Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

6. Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.

7. Write a Bash script that displays:

    To infinity and beyond indefinitely
    With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
    I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal

Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

8. Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.
